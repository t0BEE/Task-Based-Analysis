# Task-Based-Analysis
The code is used to evaluate if any performance differences for parallel, task-based programming between OpenMP and HPX exist.
C++ is choosen as progrmming language.

## Algorithm
A generic algorithm, fibonacci and mergesort are chosen to be implemented and compared.
The latter two are part of the [Barcelona OpenMP Benchmark Suite](https://github.com/bsc-pm/bots), whereas the generic algorithm is chosen to enable maximum flexibility in task size.
