\section{Environment}
  The code is executed on different systems which differ in hardware configuration.
  This might show different behavior of the implementations in different contexts.

\begin{tabular}[h]{l c c c}
 & Environment 1 & Environment 2 & Environment 3 \\\hline
CPU &  &  &  \\

\end{table}

The software specifications of the environments can be seen in table \ref{tab:softEnv}.
On all systems the same software versions are used and contain \texttt{GCC}, \texttt{HPX}, \texttt{Boost} and \texttt{OpenMP}.
HPX and Boost are installed and build by using Spack~\cite{Spack.2020} which is a package management tool.
