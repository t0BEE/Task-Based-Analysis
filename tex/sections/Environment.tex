\section{Environment}
  The code is executed on different systems which differ in hardware and software configuration.
  This might show different behavior of the implementations in different contexts.

The software specifications of the environments can be seen in table \ref{tab:softEnv}.
\texttt{GCC} is used in Version 9.2 as compiler in all environments.
