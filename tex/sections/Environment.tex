\section{Environment}
  The code is executed on different systems which differ in hardware configuration.
  This might show different behavior of the implementations in different contexts.

The hardware specifications of the four environments can be seen in table \ref{tab:hardEnv}.
Environment 1 has has an Intel Xeon Phi 7210 processor with 64 cores and the available memory is about 92 GB.
Environment 2 contains about 124 GB and an AMD EPYC 7551P processor which has a number of cores equal to 32.
The third environment owns a 64 cored AMD EPYC 7742 processor. The available memory is quite small compared to the other environments, but sufficient.
It has a size of about 3.8 GB.

The software specifications of the environments can be seen in table \ref{tab:softEnv}.
On all systems the same software versions are used and contain \texttt{GCC}, \texttt{HPX}, \texttt{Boost} and \texttt{OpenMP}.
HPX and Boost are installed and build by using Spack~\cite{Spack.2020} which is a package management tool.
