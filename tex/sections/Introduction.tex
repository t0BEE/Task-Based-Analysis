  - irregular and dynamic structures, eg while loops, dynamic inked list traversal and recursive calls
  - defining independent units of work which can be scheduled
    --> tasking
  - tasks can exploit irregular parallelism
  - mixing data and task parallelism improves the overall performance of an application (additional sources are provided)

\cite{Qawasmeh.2014}
  - two crucial issues should be managed by any task scheduler
    - data locality in terms of cache and load balancing
