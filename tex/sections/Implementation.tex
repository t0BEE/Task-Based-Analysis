\section{Implementation \& Design}
- own implementation
  - small / medium / large task sizes
  - dependencies
  - can vary the task size

	- fibonacci
		- very small tasks --> the scheduling overhead will make the difference
	- mergeSort  
		- medium task size
		
		
\subsection{Optimization}
	- decide if to do here or in Results
