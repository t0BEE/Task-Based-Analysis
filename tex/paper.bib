 abstract = {We study the simulation of stellar mergers, which requires complex simulations with high computational demands. We have developed Octo-Tiger, a finite volume grid-based hydrodynamics simulation code with Adaptive Mesh Refinement which is unique in conserving both linear and angular momentum to machine precision. To face the challenge of increasingly complex, diverse, and heterogeneous HPC systems, Octo-Tiger relies on high-level programming abstractions.  We use HPX with its futurization capabilities to ensure scalability both between nodes and within, and present first results replacing MPI with libfabric achieving up to a 2.8x speedup. We extend Octo-Tiger to heterogeneous GPU-accelerated supercomputers, demonstrating node-level performance and portability. We show scalability up to full system runs on Piz Daint. For the scenario's maximum resolution, the compute-critical parts (hydrodynamics and gravity) achieve 68.1{\%} parallel efficiency at 2048 nodes.},

@misc{Zhang.2192020,
 abstract = {OpenMP has been the de facto standard for single node parallelism for more than a decade. Recently, asynchronous many-task runtime (AMT) systems have increased in popularity as a new programming paradigm for high performance computing applications. One of the major challenges of this new paradigm is the incompatibility of the OpenMP thread model and other AMTs. Highly optimized OpenMP-based libraries do not perform well when coupled with AMTs because the threading of both libraries will compete for resources. This paper is a follow-up paper on the fundamental implementation of hpxMP, an implementation of the OpenMP standard which utilizes the C++ standard library for Parallelism and Concurrency (HPX) to schedule and manage tasks. In this paper, we present the implementation of task features, e.g. taskgroup, task depend, and task{\_}reduction, of the OpenMP 5.0 standard and optimization of the {\#}pragma omp parallel for pragma. We use the daxpy benchmark, the Barcelona OpenMP Tasks Suite, Parallel research kernels, and OpenBLAS benchmarks to compare the different OpenMp implementations: hpxMP, llvm-OpenMP, and GOMP.},
