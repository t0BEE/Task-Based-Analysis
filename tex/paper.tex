\begin{abstract}
Task-based programming is used to parallelize irregular structures like recursive function calls.
A prominent example for a run time system allowing to utilize tasks is OpenMP.
Another rather new run time system designed for task-based programming is HPX.

These two systems have not yet been compared concerning tasking performance using.
To do so the Fibonacci, Merge Sort and a generic algorithm are implemented using both run time systems.

The performances of the executions are compared and some optimization ideas are evaluated.

It came clear that both run time systems have structures they perform better with compared to the other system.
HPX has problems managing high amounts of small tasks in hierarchical structure, whereas it achieves better performance with bigger tasks and non hierarchical structures.
